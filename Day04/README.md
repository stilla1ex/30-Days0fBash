# Day 4: Loops and Repetition

## Learning Goals
Master loop constructs for automating repetitive tasks and processing data efficiently

## Concepts Covered
- For loops with ranges and lists
- While and until loops  
- Loop control (break, continue)
- Practical automation examples
- File processing with loops

## Exercises
1. `for_loops.sh` - Basic for loop syntax and ranges
2. `while_loops.sh` - While and until loops with conditions
3. `loop_control.sh` - Break and continue statements  
4. `daily_challenge.sh` - Log file analyzer

## Success Criteria
- Create loops that process files and directories
- Understand loop control flow and when to use each type
- Build automation scripts for system administration
- Handle errors gracefully in loops

## Today's Learning Path

### Step 1: For Loops (45 min)
Learn basic for loop syntax with ranges and lists

### Step 2: While/Until Loops (45 min)  
Master conditional loops and monitoring

### Step 3: Loop Control (30 min)
Use break and continue for sophisticated flow control

### Step 4: Log Analysis Challenge (45 min)
Build a practical log file analyzer

## Success Milestone
By the end of Day 4, you'll automate repetitive tasks and process files efficiently with loops.
