echo "=== PART 1: Creating Files ==="
echo
echo "Let's create an empty file:"

touch hello.txt
echo "✅ Created hello.txt"
ls -l hello.txt

echo "The -p flag creates parent directories if needed"
pause

mkdir -p work/important/secret
echo "✅ Created nested directory structure"
echo "Let's see what we built:"
ls -la
echo

echo "=== PART 4: Moving and Renaming ==="
echo
echo "Let's move our file to the projects directory:"
echo "Command: mv hello.txt projects/"
echo "mv moves files (also used for renaming)"

mv hello.txt projects/
echo "✅ Moved hello.txt to projects/"

echo "✅ Cleanup complete!"
echo

echo "🎓 What you learned:"
echo "   • touch - creates empty files"
echo "   • echo 'text' > file - puts text in a file"
echo "   • cat - displays file contents"
echo "   • cp - copies files"
echo "   • mkdir - creates directories"
echo "   • mkdir -p - creates nested directories"
echo "   • mv - moves and renames files"
echo "   • rm - deletes files"
echo "   • rm -r - deletes directories recursively"
echo "   • wc - counts lines, words, characters"
echo "   • file - identifies file types"
echo
echo "⚠️  IMPORTANT: rm deletes permanently - there's no trash!"
echo
echo "Next: Run './exercises/help_systems.sh'"
