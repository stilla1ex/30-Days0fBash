# Day 8: Error Handling and Debugging

## Learning Goals
Master error handling and debugging techniques to create robust, production-ready scripts

## Concepts Covered
- Exit codes and error detection
- Error trapping and signal handling
- Debugging techniques and tools
- Logging and error reporting
- Script robustness and reliability

## Exercises
1. `exit_codes.sh` - Exit codes and error detection fundamentals
2. `error_trapping.sh` - Advanced error handling with trap
3. `debugging_techniques.sh` - Script debugging and troubleshooting
4. `daily_challenge.sh` - Robust file processing system

## Success Criteria
- Handle errors gracefully in scripts
- Debug script issues effectively
- Implement proper logging systems
- Create bulletproof production scripts

## Today's Learning Path

### Step 1: Exit Codes (60 min)
Learn error detection and status codes

### Step 2: Error Trapping (75 min)
Master trap for robust error handling

### Step 3: Debugging Techniques (60 min)
Debug scripts effectively with built-in tools

### Step 4: Robust Script Challenge (90 min)
Build a bulletproof file processing system

## Success Milestone
By the end of Day 8, you'll write production-ready scripts with comprehensive error handling.
    fi
    
    if [[ ! -r "$file" ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Cannot read $file" >&2
        return 1
    fi
    
    wc -l "$file" || {
        echo "ERROR: Failed to process $file" >&2
        return 1
    }
}

trap 'echo "Script interrupted!" >&2; exit 1' INT TERM

for file in "$@"; do
    process_file "$file" || echo "Skipping $file due to errors"
done
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Understand exit codes and trapping
- [ ] Can debug script problems
- [ ] Built a production-ready script
